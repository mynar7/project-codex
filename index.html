                to grow daily, and with it, the need for strong junior developers. However, there exist potential gaps in
                connecting talent with opportunity. All new developers face the daunting task of gaining the experience needed
                to secure that first job, promotion, or start their own business.</p>

                grow as developers. The goal is to share valuable information and collaborate on projects in order to grow
                everyone’s careers together. We want to not only provide opportunities to learn more about the languages,
                frameworks, and practices that are crucial to the development world, but also allow members to collaborate
                and emulate the larger teams they may find in the workforce.

            <h3>A Thriving Tech Hub</h3>
            <p>Orlando is seeking to be known as the next tech hub city. The amount of available development work
                continues
                to grow daily, and with it, the need for strong junior developers. However, there exist potential gaps
                in
                connecting talent with opportunity. All new developers face the daunting task of gaining the experience
                needed
                to secure that first job, promotion, or start their own business.</p>

            <p>In partnership with a volunteer group of senior developers, the Project Codex team is creating
                opportunities
                for junior developers to participate in mentoring, coaching, and organized activities that grow and
                further
                their coding and skills while providing meaningful experiences.</p>

            <p>Hello, Orlando Developers! This group is designed to help self-taught students, alumni of Boot Camp
                programs, and CS graduates network and
                grow as developers. The goal is to share valuable information and collaborate on projects in order to
                grow
                everyone’s careers together. We want to not only provide opportunities to learn more about the
                languages,
                frameworks, and practices that are crucial to the development world, but also allow members to
                collaborate
                and emulate the larger teams they may find in the workforce.

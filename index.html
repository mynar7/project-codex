            <h3>A Thriving Tech Hub</h3>
            <p>Orlando is seeking to be known as the next tech hub city. The amount of available development work
                continues
                to grow daily, and with it, the need for strong junior developers. However, there exist potential gaps
                in
                connecting talent with opportunity. All new developers face the daunting task of gaining the experience
                needed
                to secure that first job, promotion, or start their own business.</p>

            <h3>A Focus on Juniors</h3>

                opportunities
                for junior developers to participate in mentoring, coaching, and organized activities that grow and
                further
